# Moratorium Client
I will be releasing 2 more modpacks, one the builds off of the 2nd. The next one will only enhance, fix and improve existing features or ones that meld well with vanilla lethal company.
After which, I will be going all out in features on the 3rd, just as I have done with my minecraft modpacks. Maybe i'll connect all of these platforms together sometime for anyone interested in modpacks for other games.
# Changelogs
I like my [changelogs](https://github.com/Apollonu/Abaddon-Client/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to be extensive, if there are any errors for some reason, make a Pull request and I will fix it. Do not abuse the Pull request for any reason whatsoever.
