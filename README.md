# Moratorium Client
This is the client version or [Moratorium](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Apollou/Moratorium), which will be the base of another modpack. This will only enhance, fix and improve features that are vanilla compatible. This is pretty much the [Abaddon Client](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/abaddon-client) equivalent for lethal company.
You can download [Moratorium Client](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Apollou/Moratorium_Client) on Thunderstore, others are not allowed to distribute, modify or release files from the modpack in any manner, unto others.
# Changelogs
I like my [changelogs](https://github.com/Apollonu/Moratorium-Client/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to be extensive, if there are any errors for some reason, make a Pull request and I will fix it. Do not abuse the Pull request for any reason whatsoever.
